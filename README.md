#### `What would i add/change if i had more time?`

Styling: I would add animations and maybe ask a UX designer for help (?

Tests: I would fix the one that is broken and investigate further on api testing. There is no such things as too many tests.

Code: I like pull requests comments. I do it to myself but i would love to be able to ask someone else for comments.
